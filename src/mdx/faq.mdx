### What makes this club different from other clubs?
We are a club that doesn't aim to strip your pockets of any money and encourages real work and education to help the community. We do not accept money as payment for credits and hours, as that is bribery and corruption.
Also, we have a website that is updated regularly and has powerful features, that surpasses the old deprecated Google Forms and Sheets.

### What type of events do we do?
We do various events such as, cleaning up at parks, packing food for the poor, helping out at soup kitchens, and helping the poor and elderly.

### Do we have any merch?
Not as of the moment, but if we are doing an event at their workshop (at 808 Nostrand Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11216) you can buy or ask for a shirt, they might have one.

### Do we get travel paid for on the weekends?
No, there is no actual way to allocate money for these trips, but if you really are in need of money, one of our executives knows a OMNY glitch. If we have weekday events, you can use your student Metrocard.

### How many points do we need for a credit?
The conversion rate is 25 points per credit, to a max of 8. If you exceed this, we will move it to the next year.

### Will there be events outside Brooklyn?
Yes, we try to promote equality and help out in other boroughs, although our parent organization is based in Brooklyn.
